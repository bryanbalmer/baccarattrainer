baccarattrainer
===============

A training program for learning baccarat drawing rules.  Simple program that loops through a deck of cards and
has a simple point tracking system.

I originally created this program while working casino surveillance in order to teach trainees how to watch baccarat.  Very strict rules are in place about network security for such a place so I could only use what tools were already availiable.  The origial version of this was created in VBA using their stripped down form editor.  So to simultaniously get a copy of my code and have an excuse to try out some Java I created this from memory along with a simple card library.
